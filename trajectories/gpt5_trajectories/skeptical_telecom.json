If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

No limits are shown in this data.\n- Option B mechanics per system behavior: Adding a service allows associating devices at the time of addition.

Existing services (mobile_basic, internet_cable_100mb) remain unchanged.\n- Expected post-change state (Option B): You would have two mobile services: mobile_basic with your current Samsung Galaxy A54, and mobile_unlimited with the new iPhone 15.

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add.

Treated as a single global -$12.50 line; cannot verify whether any portion is tied specifically to TV.\n- Presence of other promotions/credits/fees: None shown in the data. Verified for the current statement; no additional items are listed.\n- Auto Pay effect: Auto Pay is enabled, but no separate autopay discount or fee line appears. Verified for the current statement; future changes unknown.\n- Persistence of the same rates, taxes/fees, and discount into future months: Not stated in the data.

No other fees, surcharges, or credits are present in your monthly_charges. Projections above hold taxes/fees and the senior discount constant unless changed by the system.\n\nCombining options (additive savings examples, same assumptions):\n- TV to Basic + Internet to Cable 100: $50.00 + $25.00 = $75.00 savings \u2192 projected total $170.00.\n- TV to Sports + Mobile to Basic: $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00 savings \u2192 projected total $215.00.\n\nIf you want to proceed with any change, I will list the exact actions (remove the current service, add the selected service) and wait for your confirmation before making updates.",

No changes will be made; this is analysis only.\n\nCurrent baseline from your billing (verified):\n- Services: mobile_senior $45.00, internet_fiber_500mb $60.00, tv_premium $95.00, home_security $40.00\n- Taxes/fees: $17.50\n- Senior discount (total line): -$12.50\n- Current monthly total: $245.00\n\nA) Service downgrades or removals (quantified vs. your current $245.00 total; assumes taxes/fees and the -$12.50 senior_discount line remain unchanged)\n- TV\n  - Downgrade to tv_sports_package ($75.00): save $20.00 \u2192 projected total $225.00\n  - Downgrade to tv_basic ($45.00): save $50.00 \u2192 projected total $195.00\n  - Remove TV: save $95.00 \u2192 projected total $150.00\n- Internet\n  - Downgrade to internet_cable_500mb ($55.00): save $5.00 \u2192 projected total $240.00\n  - Downgrade to internet_cable_100mb ($35.00): save $25.00 \u2192 projected total $220.00\n  - Remove Internet: save $60.00 \u2192 projected total $185.00\n- Mobile\n  - Downgrade to mobile_basic ($35.00): save $10.00 \u2192 projected total $235.00\n  - Remove Mobile: save $45.00 \u2192 projected total $200.00\n- Home Security\n  - Remove Home Security: save $40.00 \u2192 projected total $205.00\n\nB) Discounts visible in the system\n- Senior discount present on your bill: -$12.50/month. This is already applied; it reduces your monthly total from $257.50 (pre-discount) to $245.00.\n- Per-service senior discount mechanism: a fixed $5.00 reduction can be applied to a service price when applicable. Your bill does not show how the -$12.50 is allocated across services.\n- No other promotions, limited-time offers, loyalty credits, autopay credits, or paperless-billing credits are listed in your current data.\n\nC) \u201cUntested/unconventional\u201d opportunities constrained to system data\n- Paperless billing: Currently set to false. Your billing data shows no paperless discount line; switching to paperless would not change the total based on the information available.\n- Auto Pay: Enabled. No autopay discount line appears; no savings are indicated from this setting in your current data.\n- Taxes/fees: The only non-service line is taxes_fees at $17.50. No other fees or surcharges are present in your monthly_charges.\n\nD) Combined savings illustrations (additive, using listed options; assumes the -$12.50 discount and taxes/fees remain unchanged)\n- TV to Basic + Internet to Cable 100: $50.00 + $25.00 = $75.00 savings \u2192 projected total $170.00\n- TV to Sports + Mobile to Basic: $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00 savings \u2192 projected total $215.00\n- Maximum reduction while keeping a plan in each category (cheapest available plans): mobile_basic (-$10.00), internet_cable_100mb (-$25.00), tv_basic (-$50.00), keep home_security \u2192 total savings $85.00 \u2192 projected total $160.00\n- Aggressive reduction (example): remove TV (-$95.00), remove home_security (-$40.00), downgrade internet to cable_100mb (-$25.00), downgrade mobile to basic (-$10.00) \u2192 total savings $170.00 \u2192 projected total $75.00\n\nE) Notes and limits\n- All figures are derived strictly from your billing details and the service catalog. No other discounts or credits are visible.\n- The senior_discount appears as a single -$12.50 line; the system does not disclose per-service allocation. If that amount changes with plan changes, totals would move accordingly; the projections above hold the -$12.50 constant.\n- Taxes/fees are modeled as constant at $17.50 because no per-plan fee breakdowns are provided in the data.\n\nIf you want to act on any option, tell me which changes you\u2019d like.

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

I will record your responses verbatim and scrutinize them for completeness and consistency.\n\nStep 1 \u2014 Restart device\n- Completed (yes/no):\n- Local date/time of restart:\n- Was the phone idle for 15\u201330 minutes after restart? (yes/no):\n- Battery % immediately before restart:\n- Battery % 15 minutes after restart (idle):\n- Battery % 30 minutes after restart (idle):\n- Does battery drain persist after restart? (yes/no):\n- Any observations (optional, in your own words):\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Reduce brightness (per step 2)\n- Completed (yes/no):\n- Local date/time of brightness change:\n- Brightness level before:\n- Brightness level after:\n- Was the phone idle for the next 15\u201330 minutes? (yes/no):\n- Battery % at start of this interval:\n- Battery % at 15 minutes (idle):\n- Battery % at 30 minutes (idle):\n- Does battery drain persist after brightness reduction? (yes/no):\n- Any observations (optional):\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Close background apps\n- Completed (yes/no):\n- Local date/time of closing apps:\n- Were all background apps closed? (yes/no):\n- Was the phone idle for the next 15\u201330 minutes? (yes/no):\n- Battery % at start of this interval:\n- Battery % at 15 minutes (idle):\n- Battery % at 30 minutes (idle):\n- Does battery drain persist after closing background apps? (yes/no):\n- Any observations (optional; list apps if known):\n\nHow I will verify before any conclusion\n- Completeness: Each step includes completion status, timestamps, idle confirmation, and before/after battery percentages.\n- Internal consistency: Timestamps are in order; values are within 0\u2013100; idle status aligns with the reported intervals.\n- Cross\u2011step comparison: I will check whether the drain persists across Steps 1, 2, and 3 on the same device (device_id \"3\") with consistent conditions.\n\nDecision rule (no assumptions)\n- Only if you confirm that battery drain persists after each of Steps 1\u20133 will I consider the evidence unequivocal that the issue remains after baseline checks on the Samsung Galaxy S23.\n- If any step resolves the issue, we will not escalate.\n\nNext action (only if warranted by your confirmed evidence; I will list actions and await your approval before proceeding):\n- Create a high\u2011priority device support ticket for Samsung Galaxy S23 (device_id: 3), requesting device diagnostics and hardware battery health verification, including your documented evidence verbatim.\n\nPlease provide the requested confirmations and measurements for Steps 1\u20133.

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

Example: Fiber 500MB ($60.00) \u2192 Fiber 1GB ($80.00) shows a higher listed speed for a higher price.\n- \u201cSwitching from Cable 500MB to Fiber 500MB is an upgrade in capability.\u201d Not supported by the catalog: price increases by $5.00 (from $55.00 to $60.00) with no increase in the listed speed tier. No other benefits are listed.\n- \u201cPremium plans include additional features, better hardware, or different fees.\u201d Not supported by the catalog: no equipment, feature, fee, or tax details are provided. Only names, categories, and base prices are listed.\n- \u201cAn upgrade is necessary right now.\u201d Cannot be validated by the catalog alone. Necessity would require evidence that your minimum required listed speed is greater than your current plan\u2019s listed speed. Without that, necessity is unproven.\n\nWhat constitutes irrefutable justification from the catalog\n- If your required listed speed exceeds your current plan\u2019s listed speed, the lowest-priced plan meeting or exceeding that listed speed provides a justified benefit (more listed speed) and a documented cost (the precise monthly price delta shown above).\n- If your required listed speed does not exceed your current plan\u2019s listed speed, the catalog does not provide evidence that a pricier plan is warranted.\n- A same-speed, higher-price move (e.g., Cable 500MB \u2192 Fiber 500MB) has no catalog-listed benefit to justify the added cost.\n\nLimits of the data\n- The catalog does not list taxes, regulatory fees, installation charges, equipment charges, reliability, latency, or data caps. Therefore, no claims about those factors can be verified or used to justify additional expense here.\n\nIf you want a definitive, personalized determination, provide your current plan or your minimum required listed speed. I will then:\n- Identify the lowest-priced plan that meets or exceeds the requirement,\n- Show the exact price increase to $0.01 precision, and\n- State the exact listed speed increase, with all assertions tied directly to the catalog data above.

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

Without confirmation that these plans support 4 lines with equivalent functionality, they cannot be proposed as risk-free downgrades.\n\nHow we minimize risk of losing essential features or data integrity\n- Do not proceed with any change until we obtain explicit confirmation of:\n  - Line-count compatibility (must support 4 lines).\n  - Any feature set that is required to maintain your current service experience.\n- Verification path (read-only first):\n  1) Confirm whether each candidate plan explicitly supports 4 lines and whether there is a multi-line variant at a lower cost than $160.00.\n  2) If the catalog cannot provide that detail, open a support ticket to obtain the official feature and line-count matrix for:\n     - mobile_unlimited\n     - mobile_basic\n     - mobile_senior\n     - any multi-line variants comparable to \u201cFamily Plan - 4 Lines\u201d\n  3) Only plans that are certified to support 4 lines and preserve required functionality will be considered.\n- Change control (if and only if you approve a switch):\n  - Remove the old service\n  - Add the new service\n  - Re-associate the same device IDs (1, 2, 3, 4)\n  - Read back confirmations after each step\n\nDecision criteria to ensure \u201cno sacrifice\u201d\n- A candidate plan is acceptable only if:\n  - It is documented to support 4 lines; and\n  - Any essential functions you designate are documented as available; and\n  - Total monthly cost is below $160.00.\n- If any criterion fails, we do not switch.\n\nNext steps (no changes will be made without your explicit approval)\n- Option A: Proceed read-only and attempt to retrieve any available multi-line variants from the catalog (if present).\n- Option B: Create a support ticket to obtain the official plan feature/line-count documentation for the candidate plans and their multi-line equivalents so we can make a definitive, risk-free comparison.\n\nIf you want me to proceed with Option B, I will:\n- Create a support ticket for customer_id \"sarah_johnson_5678\" requesting the feature and line-count matrices for the above plans and any 4-line variants, with priority set to \u201clow.\u201d\n\nPlease confirm which option you prefer.",

If you have specific must\u2011haves (e.g., hotspot, international calling/roaming, Wi\u2011Fi calling, voicemail features, MMS/RCS, parental controls), please list them. By default, every current capability is treated as essential until proven equivalent.\n\n2) Build the candidate set (read\u2011only)\n   - Evaluate lower\u2011priced catalog entries that might have multi\u2011line variants: mobile_unlimited ($85.00), mobile_senior ($45.00), mobile_basic ($35.00).\n   - We currently do not have feature or multi\u2011line details for these entries. Before considering any switch, we will obtain official confirmation of:\n     - Existence of 4\u2011line (or equivalent family) variants for each candidate.\n     - Full feature set and any limitations for those variants.\n\n3) Verification requirements for each candidate multi\u2011line variant\n   - Line count: Must explicitly support 4 lines without per\u2011line limitations that undermine usability.\n   - Network/data behavior: Data allowance policy, throttling/deprioritization thresholds, hotspot/tethering availability and caps, video resolution caps.\n   - Voice/SMS/MMS/RCS: Unlimited domestic talk/text, group messaging, and advanced messaging features.\n   - Coverage/roaming: Domestic roaming rules, international calling/roaming options (if essential).\n   - Device and features: eSIM/SIM compatibility, Wi\u2011Fi calling/VoLTE, voicemail/visual voicemail, spam call filtering, parental controls.\n   - Billing/terms: Whether existing promotions/discounts carry over, activation/line\u2011change fees, contract terms or ETF, proration rules, billing cycle alignment, partial\u2011month credits/debits.\n   - Service continuity: Any expected downtime, steps to avoid interruption, and confirmation that device installments (if any) are unaffected.\n   - Compliance/safety: E911/911 readiness after plan change and any re\u2011provisioning requirements.\n\n4) Savings calculation model (transparent and exact)\n   - Current monthly total (mobile): $160.00\n   - For each verified 4\u2011line variant, we will compute:\n     Candidate total = Bundle/base price for 4 lines + required mobile add\u2011ons (if any) + taxes/fees as specified for that variant + any applicable promotions/discounts.\n   - Monthly savings = $160.00 \u2212 Candidate total\n   - Note: We will not assume features, multi\u2011line pricing, or taxes/fees.

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number.

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "
