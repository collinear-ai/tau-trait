If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

              "arguments": "{\"thought\":\"We need to include refund request details and callback number in the ticket. The only tool to modify ticket is modify_support_ticket which only allows status and priority. We can't add comments via tools. The policy says to read out outputs. We need to reflect limitations and propose that a human agent will contact via the ticket. We shouldn't suggest procedures outside tools. But we can summarize that ticket is urgent and ask if they'd like us to create another ticket, but policy forbids multiple tickets for same issue. So we need to acknowledge. We may need to create a new support ticket note - but no tool provided. So we can only state we have set priority urgent and that refunds requested in prior communication; but we must not claim updates. We can request confirmation it's okay that the callback is 1234 and that refund months are July-Oct 2025; we already got that. We need to proceed to refund? There's a record_payment tool but that's for taking payments, not refunds. No refund tool. So we must escalate via ticket only. We should clarify constraints and provide timeline. Also obey monetary formatting 2 decimals where we mention $640.00. Return outputs verbatim. Provide next steps: our billing team will contact within 1 hour. Ask if anything else. We should not say we contacted them. We can state we set ticket priority urgent. Also perhaps list actions taken previously if user wants immediate. We must avoid additional tool call in same message. So we just respond with outputs we have: 'Success: Modified support ticket ...' plus a note that we have requested refunds is not possible via tool, but we can include in the ticket if there was a 'notes' field; but since we can't, we can ask to open a new ticket, but rule says don't create more than one for same issue. So we keep one. Perhaps we can ask to escalate to supervisor; but we already set to urgent. That's within our capacity.\\nWe also need to respect confidentiality on callback number; already provided 1234 and stated we will keep confidential. We should confirm the amounts: $160 per month from July-Oct 2025 totaling $640.00. We can include that in the message to be captured. But we cannot add to the ticket via tools now. However we could create a separate ticket for the 'callback info' but that would be a duplicate. Not allowed.\\nWhat about managing services? It's already removed. Good.\\nWe must also ensure we don't suggest payments or upgrades.\\nWe must \\\"When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned\\\" - we are verifying modification; we need to output the tool's result verbatim. Done.\\nWe should ask if they want us to close ticket after resolution; but not necessary.\\nWe can provide a clear statement: The ticket is urgent and open; the service was removed; we are awaiting the billing team's actions. We'll ensure callback to 1234. But again we cannot guarantee callback unless it's in ticket. We cannot add notes.\\nBut perhaps we can embed the refund request using another modify tool? There's no field. So we can't. So we should ask if they want us to include the refund details by creating a new ticket comment; but we don't have a tool for that. So we can propose to add details to the existing ticket via a human agent? The policy says transfer to a human agent if request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. Since we cannot enter the refund details into the ticket, and we already created the ticket earlier presumably without specifics. But earlier user provided the months and number. We didn't actually add details. Without ability to add notes, the ticket would lack content. However we can still relay details in the message to the user; but that won't reach support system. So we need a workaround: we could close existing ticket and create a new ticket with category billing urgent, including details? The create_support_ticket tool does not accept details beyond category/priority, so even creating a new ticket wouldn't add notes. So the tool limitation implies tickets are created without details and are handled offline. So okay.\\nThus we can proceed: We have modified ticket to urgent; now we can state: The request for refunds $640.00 and callback to 1234 within 1 hour has been logged under the urgent ticket. But we didn't log via tool. Can't claim. The policy says do not provide info not available by tools or user. But we can state: I have set ticket to urgent; our billing team will contact you. We should ask if anything else.\\nGiven the user's demand for immediate resolution, we cannot refund or process directly, so we explain the steps taken and expected timeframe, reinforcing the urgent SLA within 1 hour.\\nWe must include monetary amounts with 2 decimals.\\nReturn the tool output verbatim, then concise next steps.\\n\"}",

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number.

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "

If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When the user asks you to verify something, make sure to read out the output returned with the relevant tool call you invoke.\n\n- Do not suggest any upgrades, payments, or account modifications unless prompted explicitly to do so by the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n- Each user has a profile containing customer id, name, demographics, address, account infromation, services, devices, and billing preferences.\n\n- Each billing account has information including the customer id, account number, curent balance, last payment, next billing date, monthly charges, total monthly amount, payment history, and billing preferences (such as autopay and paperless).\n\n- Each device has information including the category of the device (mobile_phone, phone, networking, tv, security), the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, TechCorp, LG, Polycom, SecureTech, Google), and the model (Ex: iPhone 12, Galaxy S23). \n\n- Each service has information including the service id, the name of the plan, the category of the service (mobile, internet, internet, tv, security)\n\n- Each support ticket has information including the ticket ID, the customer ID, the status of the ticket (open or closed) and its priority level (low, medium, high). Low is non-urgent, medium is standard, high is important, and urgent is critical (within 24 hours). Before creating a support ticket, determine as best as possible the urgency of the situation. Do not make more than one support ticket for the same issue.\n\n## Services \n\n- When adding a service, you have the option to add devices to be associated with the service. When you do this, confirm with the user what devices they would like to add. The device ids can be found in the customer's information details. \n\n- When removing a service, all devices associated with that service will be removed from that service. \n\n- If the user seeks to switch out one service for another, you must remove the old service, then add the new service with the device ids that used to be associated with the old service.\n\n## Authentication\n\n- When authenticating a user with their email or phone number, make sure to read their customer ID back to them.\n\n## Formatting \n- If output from a tool call is to be returned to the user, all content should be output to the user verbatim as it appears in the output from the tool call. The only changes that should be made should be purely in eliminating unnecessary formatting, for example from a json dump. \n\n- All monetary amounts should be returned to 2 decimal places, even if it is a whole number. For example: $20.00. "
