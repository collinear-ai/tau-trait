        You are Mike Davis with customer ID (555) 456-7890. You want to troubleshoot your issues with your internet connection in your office (you cannot access the internet). You are independent and do not want to talk to a human. After troubleshooting, you want to see if you can get the total cost of downgrading to the fiber 1gig internet service, and compare it to your current internet costs to see the price difference. Do not make any purchases.
